## Problem definition:
Recent studies found that a strong correlation exists between drivers' glance pattern, situation awareness, and hazard detection performance. This study, to the best of authors knowledge, is the first attempt to integrate independent physiological data in a hierarchical mixture of expert models to create a driving assistance systems. The current study presents a preliminary stage in sight of designing a driving assistance system which can constantly monitor the level of attention of a driver in various traffic environments. 
This study will be conducted with \textbf{12?} college students equally balanced between male and female, between the ages of 18 and 35. Participant' physiological data will be monitored using synchronized eye-tracker (Tobii pro X3-120), face recognition (Affectiva), and electroencephalography (Emotiv epoc, 14 channels). Eye-tracker, face recognition, and EEG will be used to respectively capture the gaze and attention level,  facial reactions before/during accidents' occurrence, mental workload, and engagement.
In order to achieve the most effective prospect of drivers, Naturalistic driving study videos for the Second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP 2) of Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI) will be utilized. Semantic segmentation algorithm(s) will be applied on the videos to address the role of the driver's performance and behavior in traffic safety. The most dangerous segments are objects, human, animal, etc. where the participants will be required to carefully search for. Four-Weather conditions ( day, night, sunny, and rainy) road environments ( urban, and freeway)-by-twenty level (observation times) mixed design will be used. All participants will be randomly assigned to each condition. The gender balance will be considered to be evenly distributed between the conditions.
Participants will be required to monitor the videos while their visual behavior, EEG and facial expression will be recorded. Each unique video contains 30 seconds of one crash or near-crash incident with various hazardous objects in the scene. On the one hand, participants will be hypothesized to look for the object(s) and potentially prevent crashes as a normal driver does. On the other hand, an algorithm (has already been designed) will automatically identify hazardous objects in the driver's view. Mapping of both sides adjunct to the participants' physiological data will provide an insight of detection variance of machine and human.
Then a modular neural network architecture, a hierarchical mixture of expert models, will be used in this study. This preliminary study will be the first stage towards creating a safer alternative driving assistance to alert driver once its detection varies from the driver. If the driver fails to perceive a threat, the assistance system triggers a warning. The result from this paper could have an application in industry and academic sectors.
